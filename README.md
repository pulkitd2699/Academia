## A walk through of all the things I cracked up while being in college

1. *Operating System*
#### CPU Scheduling Algorithms

CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.

Here I have implemented the following scheduling algorithms:-
* First Come First Serve
* Round Robin (Visualization)

The code of round robin is by Shubham Singh. I have made some changes and added a functionality that will conceptualize how the time slice values vary with average Waiting Time. (Further to be improved)
